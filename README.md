#SynthFlight Pre-Alpha

SynthFlight is a fully client-side software for planning aerial photography. Run it either on the desktop or in a [browser online](https://matafokka.github.io/SynthFlight/).

This is a pre-alpha version, so expect bugs, crashes, errors, missing functions, API changes, etc.

For now, it only can plan photography by a graticule or grid. However, planning by custom polygons or flight paths is on its way.

SynthFlight also features an advanced extendable layer system for Leaflet that will be released as a separate package when it'll be ready.

You can use layers to try and compare different parameters to choose which ones suites you best.

#Installation

You don't need to install it, just [use it online](https://matafokka.github.io/SynthFlight/). However, if you want to have a local copy:

1. Download the [latest build](https://github.com/matafokka/SynthFlight/releases/latest) for the browser *(if you plan to use it in a browser)* or for your OS and platform *(if you want a standalone application)*.
1. Extract the downloaded archive wherever you want.
1. Run SynthFlight:
    1. If you've downloaded the browser build, open `index.html` file.
